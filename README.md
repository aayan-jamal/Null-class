## Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced job market, job seekers and employers require real-time insights to make informed decisions. However, existing job portals often lack dynamic analytics tools that provide actionable data on key factors such as job availability, salaries, location trends, and company sizes.

The absence of such tools leads to inefficient job searches, lack of clarity on industry trends, and challenges in matching candidates with the right opportunities. Similarly, employers struggle to analyze applicant data effectively to streamline their hiring process.

This project, "Learn to Build a Real-Time Job Analytics Portal," aims to solve these issues by creating an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides:

Real-Time Job Insights: Analytics on job titles, company sizes, experience levels, salaries, work types, and locations.
Dynamic Filtering: Filters based on candidate preferences like job title, salary range, experience, location, and more.
Data-Driven Visualization: Easy-to-interpret charts and visuals to aid decision-making for both job seekers and employers.
The report will serve as a comprehensive guide for building a real-time job analytics portal using Power BI, empowering users to harness the power of data analytics for the modern job market.
